# Fitzpatrick Classification Skin Tone Detector (Web App)

This project is a browser-based application that detects a user’s face in real-time and classifies their skin tone according to the **Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale**.  
Built using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and **MediaPipe FaceMesh**, the app provides a lightweight, fast, and privacy-first solution — all running entirely inside your browser.

## **About**

The Fitzpatrick scale is used to classify skin types according to their response to ultraviolet (UV) light.  
This web app helps you analyze your skin tone live using your webcam and classifies it instantly.

✅ Lightweight and runs entirely in the browser  
✅ No backend server needed  
✅ Privacy-first: no data is sent anywhere

## **Fitzpatrick Scale**

> The Fitzpatrick scale classifies skin types based on how they react to sun exposure:

| **Type** | **Description**                                      |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| I       | Very fair skin, always burns, never tans             |
| II      | Fair skin, burns easily, tans poorly                 |
| III     | Medium skin, burns moderately, tans uniformly        |
| IV      | Olive skin, rarely burns, tans easily                |
| V       | Brown skin, very rarely burns, tans very easily      |
| VI      | Dark brown or black skin, never burns                |

## **How It Works**

- The webcam feed is captured.
- Face landmarks are detected using **MediaPipe's Face Mesh model**.
- Specific points on the face are sampled for color information.
- Based on the average brightness of these sampled pixels, the app classifies your skin tone into the appropriate **Fitzpatrick type**.
- All processing happens locally — **no data leaves your device**.
